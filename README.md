# Recursive_Polynomial_RootFinder
C project for finding polynomial of n degree roots recursivly.
Using polynomial derivative then According to even or odd degree,finding solutions for roots using bisection algorithm and destination function.
Then using long dividion to progress and find rest of solution recursivly based on degree of the polynom
